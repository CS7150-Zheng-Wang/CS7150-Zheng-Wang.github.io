# Visualizing Conditioning Signal Influence in ControlNet: A Hybrid Approach

> Authors: Junxin (Gin) Zheng, Zhen Wang 

In this project, we investigate the dynamics of image conditioning in ControlNet using Diffusion Target Visualization (DT-Visualization) as a central analytical tool. By applying DT-Visualization to the ControlNet framework, we explore how conditioning signals influence the denoising process at each stage, revealing deeper insights into the model's internal behavior. Building on these insights, we propose a novel hybrid-net approach that strategically switches between ControlNet and standard diffusion models at intermediate timesteps as an attempt to improve inference efficiency.
